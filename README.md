# 💸 Expense Splitter – Frontend Web Application

## 📌 Brief Description

Expense Splitter is a simple frontend web application that helps groups of people split expenses in a fair and transparent way. It allows users to add members, record shared expenses, and automatically calculate how much each person owes or is owed.
